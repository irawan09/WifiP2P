# WifiP2P

Wi-Fi Direct (P2P) allows devices with compatible hardware to connect to one other over Wi-Fi without the need for an intermediary access point. When both devices support Wi-Fi P2P, you can use these APIs to discover and connect to other devices, then communicate over a fast connection over considerably longer distances than a Bluetooth connection. This is handy for apps that communicate data between users, such as a multiplayer game or a photo-sharing app.
